**Background Context:**
The AirBnB project is a crucial part of the Higher-level curriculum. This project encompasses various aspects of Python programming, including import, exceptions, class, private attribute, getter/setter, class method, static method, inheritance, unittest, and read/write file operations. Additionally, it introduces args and kwargs, serialization/deserialization, JSON handling.

**Learning Objectives:**
After completing this project, you should be able to:
- Explain Unit testing and implement it in a large project.
- Serialize and deserialize a class.
- Read and write a JSON file.
- Understand and use *args and **kwargs.
- Handle named arguments in a function.

**Copyright - Plagiarism:**
- Do not copy and paste someone else's work.
- Do not publish any content of this project.
- Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

**Requirements:**
**Python Scripts**
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Files end with a new line
- First line: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Mandatory README.md file at the project root
- Code follows pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- Length of files tested using wc
- Modules, classes, and functions documented

**Python Unit Tests**
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Files end with a new line
- Test files inside a 'tests' folder
- unittest module is used
- Test files have a .py extension
- Test files and folders start with 'test_'
- Test file organization mirrors the project structure
- Tests executed using `python3 -m unittest discover tests`

**Collaboration:**
- Encouraged to work together on test cases to cover all edge cases.
